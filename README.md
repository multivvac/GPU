Hands-On GPU Learning - 100 Day Journey

## Day 00

Trying to migrate this codebase from python to c++, so that I can implement cuda directly in the codebase.

## Day 01

Figure out how to run CUDA kernel in [GPU MODE's Leaderboard](https://gpu-mode.github.io/discord-cluster-manager/docs/intro)

Implement a histogram kernel, first implement a naive version then move on to the version with shared memory. Then submit the kernel to Leaderboard.

## Acknowledgements

Some of the quizzes and scripts are inspired by the [reference-kernel's problems](https://github.com/gpu-mode/reference-kernels). Huge thanks to the amazing GPU MODE community!
